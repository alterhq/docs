title: "Use Flow for Tool Orchestration"
description: "Let Flow automatically select and orchestrate your tools to reduce context usage and improve performance"
---

<Info>
  **Flow** is Alter's built-in tool orchestrator. Instead of loading all your enabled tools into every request, Flow acts as a single tool that intelligently routes your requests to the right tools.
</Info>

<Warning>
  **Enable Tools First** — Flow can only use tools you've already enabled in Tool Manager. It doesn't automatically enable disabled tools. Make sure the tools you need are toggled on before using Flow.
</Warning>

## Why Use Flow?

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Save Context Space" icon="compress">
    Flow loads as a single tool instead of all enabled tools, freeing up your context window for actual content
  </Card>
  <Card title="Faster Performance" icon="bolt">
    Smaller payloads process faster and reduce latency on every request
  </Card>
  <Card title="Save Fair Use Budget" icon="scale-balanced">
    Fewer tokens per request means less usage against your fair use policy budget
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Every tool you enable consumes space in your context window. When you have 10+ tools enabled, this significantly impacts performance. Flow solves this by acting as a single tool that orchestrates all others.

## Enable Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Press **⌘ ,** (Command + Comma) or click **Settings** in the menu
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Tool Manager">
    Navigate to the **Tool Manager** tab
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Flow">
    Under **Local Tools > Alter**, toggle **Flow** on
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Remember: Flow can only orchestrate tools that are already enabled. Enable the specific tools you need (Calendar, Gmail, Slack, etc.) in addition to Flow itself.
</Note>

## How Flow Works

When you send a request with Flow enabled, it follows this process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyze">
    Flow analyzes your request to understand what you're trying to accomplish
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select">
    From your enabled tools, Flow selects the appropriate tool(s) for the task
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute">
    Flow executes the tool calls in sequence, passing data between steps as needed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Summarize">
    Results are condensed into a concise response with key data points preserved
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Single Tool">
    **Request:** "What meetings do I have today?"
    
    Flow automatically:
    1. Recognizes you need calendar information
    2. Selects the Calendar tool
    3. Retrieves your meetings
    
    No need to manually select the Calendar tool — Flow handles it.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Multi-Tool Chain">
    **Request:** "Cancel my 3pm meeting and send an email to the attendees explaining I'm sick"
    
    Flow automatically:
    1. Uses the **Calendar** tool to find your 3pm meeting
    2. Identifies the attendees from the meeting
    3. Uses the **Gmail** tool to compose an email
    4. Sends the cancellation and explanation
    
    All in one natural language request.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="With Transformation">
    **Request:** "Scrape the Alter documentation and extract the key features"
    
    Flow automatically:
    1. Uses a web tool to fetch the documentation content
    2. Transforms the raw HTML using `$1:Extract the key features and format as bullet points`
    3. Returns a formatted list of features
    
    The transformation step extracts only relevant information.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## When to Use Flow vs Specific Tools

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use Flow" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    <ul>
      <li>You're not sure which tool to use</li>
      <li>You want simple, natural language requests</li>
      <li>You have many tools enabled</li>
      <li>You're doing complex multi-step tasks</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Specific Tool Actions" icon="bullseye">
    <ul>
      <li>You know exactly which tool you need</li>
      <li>You want the fastest possible execution</li>
      <li>You're building repeatable workflows</li>
      <li>You need predictable, consistent behavior</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  **90% Rule:** For 90% of tasks, Flow is the best choice. Create specific tool actions only when you need optimized, repeatable workflows.
</Note>

## Best Practice: Configure "Ask Anything"

The **Ask Anything** action is Alter's default — it's used when you type in the prompt box without selecting a specific action.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Action Editor">
    Go to **Settings > Actions**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Ask Anything">
    Look for the **"Ask Anything"** action
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Advanced">
    Expand the **Advanced** section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Only Flow">
    In the **Tools** section, select only **Flow** (deselect all other tools)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Save your changes
  </Step>
</Steps>

Now your default interactions will use Flow's orchestration instead of loading all enabled tools into every request.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="link" title="Advanced: Tool Chaining with Instructions">
    Flow automatically chains tools together when a task requires multiple steps. The output of one tool can be referenced in subsequent calls using the `$N` syntax.

    ### Reference Syntax

    | Syntax | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | `$1` | Raw output from step 1 |
    | `$2` | Raw output from step 2 |
    | `$N:instruction` | Transform step N's output using an instruction |

    ### Example with Transformation

    When scraping a website and formatting the results:

    1. Flow uses a web tool to fetch content
    2. Applies transformation: `$1:Extract the key frameworks and format as bullet points`
    3. The LLM processes the raw content before passing to the next tool

    This allows Flow to:
    - Extract only relevant information from large outputs
    - Format data appropriately for the next tool
    - Reduce noise in subsequent steps
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="memory" title="Advanced: Smart Context Management">
    Flow includes a built-in summarization step that optimizes how results are returned to your conversation.

    ### What Summarization Does

    After executing tools, Flow:

    1. **Condenses the output** — Compresses verbose tool outputs
    2. **Preserves important data** — Keeps IDs, URLs, references, and data points
    3. **Surfaces key insights** — Highlights links, ideas, and findings for follow-up
    4. **Provides source citations** — Uses [Step N] notation for traceability

    ### Why This Matters

    Without summarization, complex workflows would bloat your context window. By turn 5 or 6, you'd hit token limits.

    Flow's summarization ensures:
    - **Efficient context** — Only essential information is kept
    - **Actionable replies** — Important data points are preserved
    - **Better performance** — Less context = faster responses
    - **Traceability** — [Step N] citations verify information sources

    ### Example Output

    ```
    Task completed successfully.

    Key artifacts for next actions:
    - Meeting ID: 12345 [Step 1]
    - Attendees: alice@example.com, bob@example.com [Step 1]
    - Draft email prepared [Step 2]

    Important findings:
    - Meeting conflicts with another event at 3pm [Step 1]
    - Alice has an out-of-office message active [Step 2]
    ```

  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="pencil">
    <p><strong>Good:</strong> "Send a Slack message to the engineering channel"</p>
    <p><strong>Vague:</strong> "Message the team"</p>
    <p>Specific requests help Flow select the right tool.</p>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Chain Naturally" icon="link">
    Flow handles multi-step tasks well. Don't break complex requests into multiple prompts — let Flow orchestrate the chain.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review Results" icon="eye">
    Flow shows which tools it's using. If it selects the wrong one, rephrase your request with more detail.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="xmark" title="Flow Selected the Wrong Tool">
    Rephrase your request with more specific details:
    
    - **Instead of:** "Check my messages"
    - **Try:** "Check my unread Slack messages in the general channel"
    
    The more specific you are, the better Flow can match your intent to the right tool.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="question" title="Flow Can't Find a Tool">
    Make sure the tool is:
    - **Enabled** in Tool Manager (Flow can't use disabled tools)
    - **Properly configured** (e.g., authenticated with Gmail)
    - **Not restricted** by your action settings
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="gauge-high" title="Performance Still Slow">
    Even with Flow, very large requests can be slow. Try:
    - Breaking very complex tasks into 2-3 steps
    - Using specific tool actions for frequently repeated tasks
    - Enabling only essential tools in Tool Manager
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
