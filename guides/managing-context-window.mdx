description: "Optimize your AI interactions by understanding and managing context window usage"

<Info>
  The **context window** is the amount of text an AI model can process in a single conversation. Think of it as the model's working memory — it includes your messages, file contents, tool definitions, and the AI's responses.
</Info>

## Why Context Window Matters

Every interaction with AI consumes context space. When your context window fills up:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Performance Slows Down" icon="gauge">
    Larger payloads take longer to process, increasing response times
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fair Use Budget Depletes" icon="scale-balanced">
    More tokens per request consumes your fair use policy budget faster
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context Gets Truncated" icon="scissors">
    Older messages may be dropped, causing the AI to "forget" earlier parts of the conversation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Understanding how to manage your context window helps you get better performance and more value from Alter.

## What Consumes Context Space

### 1. Conversation History

Every message you send and every response you receive stays in context. Long conversations naturally consume more space.

### 2. File Contents

When you attach files or folders, their entire contents are injected into the context:

- **Text files** — Full content is included
- **Code files** — Entire file contents are sent
- **Documents** — Parsed text is included
- **Images** — Descriptions or OCR text is added

### 3. Tool Definitions

Every enabled tool consumes context space. A tool definition includes:

- Tool name and description
- Required and optional parameters
- Parameter descriptions and types

<Warning>
  **Tools are the silent context consumer.** Enabling 10+ tools can easily consume 30-50% of your context window before you even start typing.
</Warning>

### 4. System Instructions

Background prompts, grounding documents, and system instructions all consume space.

## How Tools Consume Context

Here's a real example of how tools impact your context:

| Tools Enabled | Approximate Context Used | Remaining for Your Content |
|--------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| 0 tools | ~5% | ~95% |
| 5 tools | ~15% | ~85% |
| 10 tools | ~30% | ~70% |
| 20 tools | ~50% | ~50% |
| 30+ tools | ~70%+ | ~30% |

<Note>
  These are approximate values. Actual usage varies based on tool complexity and description length.
</Note>

## Strategies for Managing Context

### 1. Use Flow for Tool Orchestration (Recommended)

The most effective way to reduce tool-related context consumption is to use **Flow** — Alter's built-in tool orchestrator.

<Card title="Flow loads as a single tool" icon="wand-magic-sparkles" href="/guides/use-flow-orchestration">
  Instead of loading all your enabled tools into every request, Flow acts as one tool that intelligently selects and orchestrates the right tools for each task.
  
  **Benefits:**
  - Reduces context usage by 60-80%
  - Improves response times
  - Automatically handles multi-step tasks
  - Saves fair use budget
</Card>

**Best Practice:** Configure your default "Ask Anything" action to use only Flow instead of all enabled tools.

### 2. Disable Unused Tools

Only enable tools you actively use:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review your tools">
    Go to **Settings > Tool Manager** and see what's enabled
  </Step>
  <Step title="Disable unused tools">
    Toggle off tools you haven't used in the past week
  </Step>
  <Step title="Re-enable when needed">
    You can always re-enable tools — they remember your authentication
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 3. Customize Tool Sets for Actions

Every action can be configured with its own specific tools. This is a powerful way to control context usage:

#### Ask Anything Action

The **Ask Anything** action is the default used when you type in the prompt box without selecting a specific action. It runs everywhere in Alter — minimize your tool selection here for maximum impact.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Action Editor">
    Go to **Settings > Actions**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Ask Anything">
    Select the "Ask Anything" action
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Advanced">
    Expand the Advanced section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Limit Tools">
    Select only the tools you absolutely need (or just Flow)
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Custom Actions

When creating custom actions, think carefully about which tools are actually needed:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Learn from Defaults" icon="book-open">
    Most built-in Alter actions have tools disabled by default. For example, "Correct Grammar" doesn't need any tools — it's a pure text transformation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be Minimal" icon="filter">
    Only enable tools your specific workflow requires. If your action just formats text, you probably don't need any tools.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

#### Flow vs Specific Tools

<Info>
  **Use Flow** when you want flexibility and don't know which specific tools you'll need. It handles tool selection automatically.
</Info>

<Info>
  **Use specific tools** when you know exactly which tools your workflow needs. This gives better performance and fewer back-and-forth turns with the AI.
</Info>

**Example:** If you're building an action that just creates calendar events, enable only the Calendar tool rather than Flow. This eliminates the tool selection step and executes faster.

### 4. Use Workspaces for Large Files

Instead of attaching large files to every conversation:

- Create a **workspace** for projects with large files
- Reference the workspace when needed
- Clear workspace context when switching tasks

<Card title="Learn about Workspaces" icon="folder-open" href="/guides/core-features#workspaces">
  Workspaces help organize files and manage context more efficiently
</Card>

### 4. Clear Context Regularly

Use **⌘ K** (Command + K) to clear all contexts when:

- Starting a new, unrelated task
- Previous context is no longer relevant
- Responses are getting slow

### 5. Summarize Long Conversations

For very long conversations:

- Export the conversation to a file
- Start a new conversation with a summary
- Reference the exported file if needed

### 6. Be Selective with File Attachments

Instead of attaching entire folders:

- Attach only the specific files you need
- Remove files from context when done with them

## Monitoring Context Usage

While Alter doesn't show a real-time context meter, you can monitor usage indirectly:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Watch Response Times" icon="clock">
    Slower responses often indicate high context usage
  </Card>
  <Card title="Check Tool Count" icon="toolbox">
    More enabled tools = more context consumed. Review Tool Manager regularly.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
