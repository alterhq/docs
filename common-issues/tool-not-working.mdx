title: "Tools Not Working"
description: "Fix integrations when Alter won't use your connected tools and apps"
---

<Note>
  **Quick check:** Does your chosen AI model support tools? Some smaller models don't have tool-calling capabilities.
</Note>

## What's happening?

You ask Alter to do something like "Send a message to John" or "Add a calendar event," but:
- The AI responds with text instead of taking action
- Nothing happens in the target app
- You get "I don't have access to that" or similar responses

## Why this happens

  <Card title="Model Doesn't Support Tools" icon="brain">
    Some AI models can't call tools – they only generate text

  <Card title="Tool Not Enabled" icon="toggle-off">
    The tool is available but not turned on in Tools Manager
  </Card>
  <Card title="Wrong Prompt Format" icon="message">
    The AI needs clear instructions about what tool to use and how

## Step-by-step fix

<Steps>
  <Step title="Switch to a tool-capable model">
    Not all models can use tools. Try one of these:
    - **Alter Best** (our smart router)
    - **Gemini 2.0 Flash**
    - **Claude Sonnet**
    - **GPT-5**
    
    Press `/` in the prompt box to switch models.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check the global tools toggle">
    In the Tools Manager, there's a master switch that can disable **all** tools at once:
    1. Click the **three dots** in Alter → **Tools Manager**
    2. Look for the global toggle in the **Active Tools** section
    3. Make sure it's turned **on** (enabled)
    
    If this is off, none of your individual tools will work even if they're enabled.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable the right tools">
    Once the global toggle is on, enable specific tools:
    1. In the Tools Manager, find the tool you want (Messages, Calendar, etc.)
    2. Toggle it **on**
    3. Check if it needs additional setup (like signing in)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Be explicit in your request">
    Instead of: *"Tell John I'm running late"*
    
    Try: *"Send a message to John Smith saying 'I'm running 10 minutes late' using the Messages tool"*
    
    The more specific you are, the better the AI understands.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="For Apple Shortcuts">
    If using Apple Shortcuts:
    1. Open the **Shortcuts** app
    2. Edit your shortcut
    3. Add "Receive input from" and set it to accept text
    4. Save the shortcut
    5. Try again in Alter
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Test it

Try this simple test:
1. Make sure you're using a tool-capable model
2. Enable the **System Notification** tool
3. Say: "Send a system notification saying 'Test successful'"
4. **Success:** You should see a macOS notification appear!

<Tip>
  **Start simple:** Test with basic tools like System Notification before trying complex integrations. This helps identify if it's a general tool issue or specific to one integration.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Try Flow:** If you're unsure which tool to use or having trouble with tool selection, enable [Flow](/guides/use-flow-orchestration) - Alter's tool orchestrator that automatically selects the right tool for you.
</Tip>

## Still not working?

Some models are better at tools than others. If one model isn't working well with tools:
1. Switch to **Alter Best** (it automatically picks capable models)
2. Or try **Gemini 2.0 Flash** or **Claude Sonnet**
