title: "Microphone Not Working"
description: "Fix voice input and dictation issues when Alter doesn't transcribe your speech"
---

<Note>
  **Quick check:** Is your Mac's microphone working in other apps like Voice Memos? If not, this is a system issue, not an Alter issue.
</Note>

## What's happening?

You're holding the microphone button or pressing your voice hotkey, but:
- Nothing happens when you speak
- The dictation starts but no text appears
- The recording indicator shows but stays blank

## Common causes

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Missing Permissions" icon="shield">
    Alter doesn't have permission to access your microphone
  </Card>
  <Card title="Wrong Voice Processor" icon="microphone">
    Local voice models aren't downloaded or configured
  </Card>
  <Card title="Language Mismatch" icon="language">
    Automatic language detection isn't working for your accent
  </Card>
  <Card title="Wrong Input Device" icon="speaker">
    Alter is using the wrong microphone or system default isn't working
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How to fix it

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Microphone Permissions">
    1. Open **System Settings** on your Mac
    2. Go to **Privacy & Security** → **Microphone**
    3. Make sure **Alter** is enabled in the list
    4. If it's already on, try toggling it off and back on
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select the Right Input Device">
    By default, Alter uses your system default microphone, but macOS doesn't always handle this correctly:
    1. Look for the **control block** in Alter's interface (or check the menu bar)
    2. Click to open the device selector
    3. Choose your specific microphone from the list
    4. Try speaking again

    This fixes issues like:
    - Alter not picking up any audio despite permissions being granted
    - Meeting recordings capturing only the other participant and not you
    - Low quality or intermittent audio input
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Voice Processor Settings">
    1. In Alter, open **Settings** (`Cmd + ,`)
    2. Go to the **Dictation** tab
    3. Check that **Voice Processor** is set to:
       - **Cloud** (for best accuracy)
       - **Local (Apple)** (for privacy)
       - Or download a Whisper model if you want offline processing
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Language Explicitly">
    If automatic detection isn't working:
    1. In **Settings** → **Dictation**
    2. Change **Dictation Language** from "Automatic" to your specific language
    3. Try dictating again
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Both Modes">
    Try both ways of voice input:
    - **Hold to speak**: Hold `Fn` (or your voice hotkey), speak, then release
    - **Click to dictate**: Click the mic icon once to start, click again to finish
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Did it work?

Try this quick test:
1. Hold your voice hotkey (default is `Fn`)
2. Say "Hello, this is a test"
3. Release the key
4. **Success:** You should see "Hello, this is a test" appear in the prompt box

<Tip>
  **Still having issues?** Try restarting Alter after granting permissions. Sometimes macOS needs a fresh start to recognize new permissions.
